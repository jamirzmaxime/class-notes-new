            <h3>Hominins and Hominids</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hominins</strong> - modern human, extinct human, and human-like creatures</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><em>Humans are the only Hominins alive</em></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Only hominins developed bipedal locomotion <strong><em>(they walk on their back legs/walk on 2 legs)</em></strong></li>
                <li>Hominins are the only species to utilize the creation of fire</li>
                <li><strong>Hominids</strong> - modern Great apes and their predecessors <strong><em>(humans can be Hominids, but think of them as Hominin)</em></strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Homo sapiens (thinking of skillful man) - orginated in Africa migrated to the Middle East, Europe, and Asia around 100,000 years ago</p>

            <h2>Paleolithic Age (Old Stone Age)</h2>
            <p><strong><em>Dates to around the first use of tools, around 2 million years ago, to about 10,000 BCE</em></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hand axes were the only tool hominids made for nearly 2 million years</li>
                <li>People lived in small bands, probably consisting of extended family and relatives</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><em>*All humans were hunter-gatherers</em></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There have been many humans who actually lived in some permanent shelters</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>*The human population experienced a Great Leap Foward sometime around 80,000-70,000 years ago</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The reason for this was humans' development of speech, accompanied by abstract thought</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Because Humans developed speech and abstract thought, this led to cave paintings that date around 30,000-20,000 years ago</em></p>
            <p><strong>Animism</strong> - the belief that all objects in nature have spirits</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Around 30,000-25,000 years ago, you started to see pregnant women statues called <strong><em>Venus figures</em></strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><em>Fertility was a vital part of an often uncertain life, both for people and their prey</em></strong></p>
            <p>From 30,000-10,000 BCE is referred to as the <strong><em>Mesolithic Period</em></strong>, where our ancestors made significant accomplishments and advancements</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Like fishhooks, needles, and other sophisticated tools</li>
                <li>Also, the first humans made shelter like huts and hide covered frame of wood or mammoth tusks</li>
                <li>The domestication of the dog also happened around 15,000 years ago</li>
                <li>This era also led to the most important development made by humans of this era agriculture</li>
            </ul>
